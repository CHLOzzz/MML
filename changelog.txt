---v2.0.0---
Unofficial pre-release! 2 modules are provided in the plugin to get things running; the Square Root Quantizer (SQT QNT) and the Base 2 Logarithm Quantizer (LOG QNT).

- All provided quantizers take a simple voltage input, and return a simple voltage output that maps notes on a chromatic musical scale and rearranges them into the shape of a mathematical function.
- SQT QNT is the shape of the square root function.
